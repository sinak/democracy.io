    <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
      <p>The coalition of organizations behind Democracy.io takes your privacy seriously. Among our fundemental principles:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>We do not sell our email list. We do not share or distribute your contact information unless specifically stated so.</li>
      <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we need it.</li>
      <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for a specific organizational effort, such as delivering a message to congress, connect you via phone to your representatives, deliver a petition or in order to communicate with you about an upcoming effort.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
      <p>Like many websites, Democracy.io collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Democracy.io’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Democracy.io’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Democracy.io may share non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate with organizations and employees of organizations that are members of the coalition, e.g., for example the number of visitors or signups during a particular period.</p>
      <p>Democracy.io also uses potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for the purpose of geolocating users to show appropriate actions and content. For example, if you are based in the US, we will use your IP address to show you content about pending laws in the US Congress. However, Democracy.io does not store IP addresses, and would only disclose IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
      <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
      <p>Certain visitors to Democracy.io's websites choose to interact with Democracy.io in ways that require Democracy.io to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Democracy.io gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to be part of the day of action to provide an email address so that we may contact them. Those who engage in actions with Democracy.io – by sending an email to Congress or calling their representatives, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal information required to process those actions. In each case, Democracy.io collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Democracy.io. Democracy.io does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
